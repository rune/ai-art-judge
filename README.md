One of the great things about the AI in the Rune SDK is that it exposes image analysis as part of the same single API. AI Art Judge uses this to become an art critic. Players suggest a 'thing' to be drawn. They're then given a fixed time to draw a picture of the randomly picked item. Once everyone is done, the AI evaluates the drawings based on the original input and provides an overly artsy and funny critique. It turns out AI is an expert in being pompous.
